Quick and dirty setup for my `VIM` switching between OS and VMs. I'm a nooby and experiment a lot with the editor, so - no guarantees whatsoever, that you will find something for your configs here. Furthermore I find VIM's over customization not very well suited for my case.

It is a bit barbaric, but I'm able to move pretty much freely between environments, having same editor experience. Almost *every* thing is default, no fancy hotkeys or plugins. Just pure coding habits.

**NOTE:** Since there are some plugins installed, `Vundle` needs to be setup via this line:

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
