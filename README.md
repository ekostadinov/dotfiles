Quick and dirty setup for my `VIM` switching between OS and VMs. I'm a nooby and experiment a lot with the editor, so - no guarantees whatsoever, that you will find something for your configs here. Furthermore I find VIM's over customization not very well suited for my case. It is a bit barbaric, but I'm able to move freely between environments having same editor experience. Almost *every* thing is default, no fancy hotkeys or plugins. Just pure coding habits.
